# JavaScript Lessons Documentation

## Overview

I have created this repo to serve as a comprehensive guide to JavaScript concepts and advanced programming techniques tailored for team learning and development. It was created to provide a structured and detailed approach to mastering JavaScript, enabling both foundational understanding and the ability to tackle complex, real-world applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:
1. Build a strong foundation in JavaScript for developers of all levels catering to needs of each person in our team.
2. Introduce modern tools, techniques, and best practices used in contemporary software development.
3. Provide in-depth lessons that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical coding applications.
4. Serve as a reference guide for the ongoing development of our team project, the Food Truck App.
